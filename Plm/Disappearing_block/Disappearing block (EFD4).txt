Disappearing/Reappearing blocks

Author: Kejardon

Place this plm on top of the block you want to use
It will use the gfx of whichever block it is placed on

Block type = type during initial delay (must be solid or air)
BTS value  = timer for initial delay
High 	   = timer for block to be air per cycle
Low 	   = timer for block to be solid per cycle

Timer approximations:
01 = 1/4 second (Exact value: 0.26666... seconds)
04 = 1 second
08 = 2 seconds
0C = 3 seconds
10 = 4 seconds
80 = 34 seconds
FF = 68 seconds

*note*
The time it takes for the block to disappear or reappear is exactly 1 timer tick.
